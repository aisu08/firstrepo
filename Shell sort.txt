1) Create an Array and Get Elements

2) Initialize an array and get input from the user for the elements that need to be sorted.

3) Set the initial gap to half the size of the array.

4) Repeat the process while the gap is greater than zero.

5) For each gap, perform an insertion sort on the subarrays that are spaced by the gap.

6) After each pass, reduce the gap by half.

7) After each pass, print the current state of the array.
